# example_1-extended (photoArt 3D)

photoArt 3D is based on the photoArt system (http://photoart.manuel.bz) that detects brightness and shapes of a photo and renders them  into an artistic picture. This 3D version uses babylon.JS in order to create a vector based 3D picture.

## Getting Started

The system needs to be started with some kind of webserver/liveserver/localhost to allow the js canvas object to access the pixel information of the photo that gets processed.

## Built With

* [babylon.JS]https://www.babylonjs.com/) - The 3d framework used
* [jquery PEP](https://github.com/jquery/PEP) - additional framework used

## Authors

* **Manuel Zomer** - [zomer.se](http://zomer.se)

## Acknowledgments

* babylon.JS Polyhedra example (https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#21QRSK#15)

The creation of the shapes and rotation of them is based on the Polyhedra example of the babylonjs-playground, everything else is coded from the ground up.
