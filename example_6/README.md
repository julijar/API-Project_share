# example_6 (3D coordinate system)

Example 6 shows a simple 3D coordinate system. A user could change the length of all the axis and also use its own unit for measuring lenght. It can also be used for locating an object.

## Getting Started

The system needs to be started with some kind of webserver/liveserver/localhost in order to load the textures correctly.

## Built With

* [babylon.JS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) - The 3d framework used
* [jquery PEP](https://github.com/jquery/PEP) - additional framework used

## Authors

* **Fariborz Ghadir** - [zomer.se](http://zomer.se)

* babylon.JS Physics example (https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#13XUOM#1)

The example is based on the babylonjs-playground's, simple changes got made on the axis length and color. The idea is that if you combine this example with the example 3 (data visualization), you can locate the bulding in which energy consumption is too high.
