# example_7 (Physics)

Example 7 showcases the possibilities of using physics in babylon.JS. A three dimensional box is painted on the scene and 100 red-white balls (spheres) are falling from the sky into the open box. When clicking on the surface of the box a blue-white ball is created which hits the ground exactly at the clicked position.

## Getting Started

The system needs to be started with some kind of webserver/liveserver/localhost in order to load the textures correctly.

## Built With

* [babylon.JS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) - The 3d framework used
* [jquery PEP](https://github.com/jquery/PEP) - additional framework used

## Authors

* **Manuel Zomer** - [zomer.se](http://zomer.se)

## Acknowledgments

* babylon.JS Physics example (https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#7149G4#0)
* babylon.JS picking Objects on a 3D surface example (https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#NU4F6Y)

The example is based on the babylonjs-playground's physics example, a variety of changes got made on the box structure and materials as well as a function to add your own blue-white balls on the scene via clicking got implemented. This function is inspired from the picking objects on a 3D surface example on the babylonjs-playground.
