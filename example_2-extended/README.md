# example_2-extended
Example 2 showcases an human shaped figure that performs a variety of animations. The original program has buttons which perform different movements. I've removed the gui and changed the animations to keyboard buttons.
W = walk forward, S = stop, R = run, A = walk left and D = walk right.
