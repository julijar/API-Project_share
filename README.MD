# API Project babylon.JS

The project's main focus is the framework babylon.JS which is a openGL based 3D framework on JavaScript basis. All the resources that allow babylon.JS to function are loaded via CDN, so no extra installation is needed when using provided examples.
The project is made from 8 examples in babylon.JS, 4 of them of extended nature. Every example showcases another aspect babylon can be used in. From creating simple 3D scenes all over to complex animations and integrated Physics. 
Purpose of the project is to show the broad range of options a 3D library like babylon gives to the user and inspiring for what kind of scenarios it can be used. 
BabylonJS features lots of ways it can be used, and especially for designers there are several features that can make ones live easier. Starting from the quick and easy setup that allows everyone without any deep knowledge of three dimensional programming to create an interactive 3D prototype.
It can be also seen as a simple tool to create visually appealing 3D data visualization which is examplewise showcased in example number 3. With some more technical knowledge babylon.JS is furthermore a perfect tool to prototype and also create 3D video games or any kind of interactive 3D object.
This project explores babylon.JS from a variety of different angles with view on prototyping different kinds of data visualization, 3D animations and interactions as well as creating computer generated interactive art and graphics. 

## Getting Started

The system needs to be started with some kind of webserver/liveserver/localhost to be able to run all examples without any issues in loading textures and or images. The code for most of the examples is present on one single html file, apart from example 1 which has a designated css and js file. Babylon.JS specific code is mainly in the createScene function, the rest is mostly a construct for babylon.JS to run and function. 
Because babylon.JS works via CDN there is no further installation required to get started.
