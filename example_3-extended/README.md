# example_3 

Example 3 showcases the possibilities of using babylon.js for data visualization. Hundreds of cubes are designed on the scene which associates buildings of an imaginary area. When using arrow buttons, a user can control view angles.

## Getting Started

The system needs to be started with some kind of webserver/liveserver/localhost in order to load the textures correctly.

## Built With

* [babylon.JS]https://www.babylonjs.com/) - The 3d framework used
* [jquery PEP](https://github.com/jquery/PEP) - additional framework used

## Authors

* **Fariborz Ghadir** - [Portfolio](https://ioio.mah.se/courses/IDK18/IDK18_0055/)

* babylon.JS data visualization example (https://https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#2FPT1A#36)

The example is based on the babylonjs-playground's, simple changes got made on the box colors and as well as a function to generate your own color. The basic idea is that to show how high consumption of energy is inside the buildings. So buildings with warm colors are the one in which the consumption of energy are higher than it should be.
